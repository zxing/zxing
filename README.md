## Project in Maintenance Mode Only; Barcode Scanner not available

The project is in maintenance mode, meaning, changes are driven by contributed patches.
Only bug fixes and minor enhancements will be considered. The Barcode Scanner app can
no longer be published, so it's unlikely any changes will be accepted for it. 
It does not work with Android 14 and will not be updated. Please don't file an issue for it.
There is otherwise no active development or roadmap for this project. It is "DIY".

## Get Started Developing
