ZXing for iOS is a sub-project of zxing project partially maintained by 
independent developers. As of 26th of March 2011, it contains 3 iOS projects:
  - BarCodes:  Zxing iOS app. Available on app store. 
  - ZXingWidget: a Library that can be included in any iOS app
  - ScanTest: a simple demo app for ZXingWidget


How to include ZXingWidget in a easy and clean way (in XCode4):
====================================================

  1. Locate the "ZXingWidget.xcodeproj" file under "`zxing/iphone/ZXingWidget/`". Drag ZXingWidget.xcodeproj and
     drop it onto the root of your Xcode project's "Groups and Files"  sidebar.  A dialog will
     appear -- make sure "Copy items" is unchecked and "Reference Type" is "Relative to Project"
     before clicking "Add". Alternatively you can right-click on you project navigator and select 'Add files to "MyProject"'  
   
  2. Now you need to link the ZXingWidget static library to your project.  To do that,
      a. select you project file in the project navigator
      b. In the second column, select your _target_ and not the project itself  
      c. Go to the 'build phases' tab, expand the 'link binary with libraries' section,
			d. Click the add button A dialog will appear and you should see libZXingWidget.a in the very first possibilities
  
  3. Now you need to add ZXingWidget as a dependency of your project, so Xcode compiles it whenever
	 you compile your project. 
	    a. like in substep c. of previous step, you nedd to do that in the 'build phases' tab of your target
	    b. Expand the 'Target Dependencies' section
	    c. Click the add Button and a dialog will appear select ZXingWidget target
  
  4. Headers search path 1: you need to tell your project where to find the ZXingWidget headers. Select your project in the 
     project navigator, and the select your target and go to the "Build Settings" tab. Look for "Header Search Paths" and double-click
	 it.  Add the relative path from your project's directory to the
	 "zxing/iphone/ZXingWidget/Classes" directory. Make sure you click the checkbox "recursive path" ! 
  
  5. Headers search path 2: You need to add zxing cpp headers to your headers search path, do this similarly as previous step to point the path to cpp/core/src/ where the 'zxing' directory is. Do not check the "recursive path" option for this path.

	6. Import the following iOS frameworks: 
	   a. AVFoundation
	   b. AudioToolbox
	   c. CoreVideo
	   d. CoreMedia
	   e. libiconv
	   f. AddressBook
           g. AddressBookUI
	   This must be done by adding them in the 'Link Libraries with Binary' just like step 2.c. If you are
           supporting iOS 4, for AVFoundation, you must select 'Optional' in the pull down to the right in order to
           weak link the framework. (Some symbols used in ZXing didn't exist before iOS 5.)
 
  7. You're almost ready to go ..
  
  8. #import <ZXingWidgetController.h> in a source file
  
  9. #import <QRCodeReader.h> for example because you will need to inject a barcode reader into ZXingWidgetController. 

  10. MAKE SURE the file in which you are using the code deader is a .mm because you are now silently including some c++ code. If you don't do so then
     the compiler may cry as if it does not find some files !

  11. It should work :)
  

Known issues for above steps to include:
======================================
  - It can happen that when trying to build your own project with ZXingWidgetController you get linker errors like 
    "undefined reference to". If this error looks like a c++ undefined reference, then renaming main.m into main.mm (Objective-C++ source suffix)
    may fix the problem
  
  - If you have building error like " ... : No such file or directory", then it is a classical error, it means that the path to includes is not well
    specified. The best way to fix this is to look at the Build Command that failed. To do that, click on the lower right corner of your Xcode project,
    you should see the build command that failed. Click on it and expand it by clicking on the "more" symbols that just appeared. This will make appear
    the exact command line instruction that is ran and fails. You can then make sure that the Header search path you specified is there, and you can also
    copy/paste this line into your terminal and try to see if you can reproduce/fix the error by adding the right path to the compiler. Once is is fixed,
    you should have an idea of what's the problem and accordingly modify your Header Search Path.
    
  - You could have issue of building AdHoc or release build in Xc4 with "No Packager exists for the type of archive" message - see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5271496/xcode4-ios-4-3-no-packager-exists-for-the-type-of-archive/5322743#5322743
