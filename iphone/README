independent developers. As of 2nd of June 2010, it contains 3 iPhone projects:
  - BarCodes: Original zxing iPhone app. Available on app store. However, the code is cirrently maintained
  - ZXingWidget: a Library that can be included in any iPhone app
  - ScanTest: a simple test app for ZXingWidget


How to include ZXingWidget in a easy and clean way:
====================================================

  1. Locate the "ZXingWidget.xcodeproj" file under "`zxing/iphone/ZXingWidget/`". Drag ZXingWidget.xcodeproj and
     drop it onto the root of your Xcode project's "Groups and Files"  sidebar.  A dialog will
     appear -- make sure "Copy items" is unchecked and "Reference Type" is "Relative to Project"
     before clicking "Add".    
   
  2. Now you need to link the ZXingWidget static library to your project.  Click the "ZXingWidget.xcodeproj" 
	 item that has just been added to the sidebar.  Under the "Details" table, you will see a single
	 item: ZXingWidget.a.  Check the checkbox on the far right of ZXingWidget.a.
  
  3. Now you need to add ZXingWidget as a dependency of your project, so Xcode compiles it whenever
	 you compile your project.  Expand the "Targets" section of the sidebar and double-click your
	 application's target.  Under the "General" tab you will see a "Direct Dependencies" section. 
	 Click the "+" button, select "ZXingWidget", and click "Add Target"
  
  4. Finally, we need to tell your project where to find the ZXingWidget headers.  Open your
	 "Project Settings" and go to the "Build" tab. Look for "Header Search Paths" and double-click
	 it.  Add the relative path from your project's directory to the
	 "zxing/iphone/ZXingWidget/Classes" directory. Make sure you click the checkbox "relative path" !
 
  5. You're ready to go. Just #import <ZXingWidgetController.h> from anywhere and it should work !
