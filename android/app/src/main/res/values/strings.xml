        While we have attempted to emsure proper operation, the functions may not work properly once
        the application is installed on your device. The application requires a camera and may not
        work perfectly on some cameras at some light levels, so it may not scan correctly on occasion.
        The results returned may be incorrect when scans are incorrect, and there will be no way to
        tell that this has occurred. The results can therefore not be warranted to be correct or useful,
        it simply provides guidance to be considered.\n
        We may release new versions from time to time but there is no guarntee that this will occur.\n
        We may attempt to correct bugs and problems in the application\'s operation from time to time but
        there is no guarantee that this will occur, and there is no process available to gain attention
        from the authors if they are unavailable at their sole discretion.\n
        In other words, we give this away free and while it may be useful, if we move on it will not get
        fixed or enhanced, and that may occur at any time with no warning and no recourse.\n
        The user may of course uninstall the applicationa at any time.\n
        While we have endevored to respect all licenses and legal requirements, if we become aware that we
        have violated any copyrights or patents by producing this application and making it available we
        will remove the application if needed and in that case we will ask that all users of the application
        also uninstall it.

        The license does not terminate but the accuracy may well decline over time as company owners change

    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

\n
    (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,

    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
\n
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n

    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n

        A license activity has been added that shows this license.\n
