<p>Barcode Scanner continuously scans a square region shown on your screen -- just line up the phone so the barcode is completely inside the viewfinder rectangle:</p>
<p class="imgcenter"><img src="../images/demo-yes.png" style="padding:5px"/><img src="../images/demo-no.png" style="padding:5px"/></p>
<p>1D barcodes like those found on products require a phone with autofocus. Without it, only 2D formats like QR Codes and Data Matrix codes will be scannable.</p>
<p>When a barcode is read, a beep sound will play and you'll see the results of the scan, a description of what the barcode contains, and options to take action on the contents.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble scanning, make sure to hold the phone steady. If the camera is unable to focus, try moving the phone further or closer from the barcode.</p>
