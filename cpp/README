This is only tested on Linux. With some trouble, it might work on Windows as well.

The build process uses scons, a build tool written in python. You'll
need to have python installed, but scons installation is optional: a
runtime copy of scons (called scons-local) is included with zxing. To
use the included copy of scons-local, where the instructons says enter
"scons", enter "python scons/scons.py" instead. For example, to build
the library only, you'd use "python scons/scons.py lib" instead of
"scons lib".

To build the library only:
- Run "scons lib" in this folder (cpp)

To build the unit tests:
- Install cppunit (libcppunit-dev on Ubuntu)
- Run "scons tests"
- Run "testrunner" in the build folder

To build the test utility:
- Install Magick++ (libmagick++-dev on Ubuntu)
- Run "scons zxing"

An simple example application is now also included, but no compilation instructions yet.

To clean:
- Run "scons -c all"

To use the test utility:
- Basic usage:
  - "mkdir testout"
  - "zxing testout *.jpg > report.html"
- With the zxing test data, from the cpp folder:
  - "mkdir testout"
  - "build/zxing testout ../core/test/data/blackbox/qrcode-*/* > report.html"

To format the code:
 - Install astyle
 - Run ./format

To profile the code (very useful to optimize the code):
 - Install valgrind
 - "valgrind --tool=callgrind build/zxing - path/to/test/data/*.jpg > report.html"
 - kcachegrind is a very nice tool to analize the output

To run the blackbox tests and check for changes:
 - build the test util, e.g., scons zxing
 - run the tests: bash blackboxtest.sh 2>&1 | tee bb.results
 - diff them with the known results: diff bb.results blackboxtest.results
