    for nonstandard QR Codes that don't use ISO-8859-1

0.4.5 (22 Feb 2008)
  - Checked in first minimal working Blackberry client. Still quite crude.
  - Fixed UTF-8 detection again
  - Refactored Reed-Solomon to allow different GF(256) primitive polynomials,
    in preparation for Data Matrix
  - Slight improvement to 1D decoding accuracy, most noticeable in
    improvements to Code 128 decoding

    to top or left

0.5 (05 Mar 2008)
  - Improvement in QR Code decoding accuracy on non-JSR-234 phones
  - Supports "URLTO" data in barcodes.
  - Restructured ParsedReaderResult parsing code to not use so many
    exceptions, for more efficiency.
  - "TRY_HARDER" decoding hint now supported. Will do more work in some cases
    to find an image, such as scan for 1D barcodes at a right angle and
    backwards. Only recommended for non-mobile applications.
  - Result now indicates the format of the decoded barcode with a
    BarcodeFormat instance
  - More intelligent handling of POSSIBLE_FORMATS decoding hint
  - Fixed sub-optimal handling of EAN-13 barcodes which encode a string
    starting with "0". These are now returned as a full 13-digit string
    from EAN13Reader, but will continue to be construed as 12-digit UPC-A
    codes from the MultiFormatReader.
  - A host of small bug fixes, including bug in Version 25 QR Code support

  - Added initial support for short NDEF messages, but not yet enabled
  - Bug fix to corner-case of perspective transformation code
  - Now attempts to configure camera's exposure controls if available
  - Fixed rotation transform used in "try harder" mode; result did not
    contain the whole image
  - "Try harder" mode tries 2D formats first to avoid false positives
    in detailed search for 1D codes, in some cases
  - More aggressive inlining by ProGuard, notable performance boost
  - Small Reed-Solomon optimizations for 0- and 1-error case
  - Refactored GridSampler out into common package for use by Data Matrix

  - Added support for MobileTag message formats
  - Added source to zxing.org
  - Significant work on Android clients, including UI overhaul and
    continuous scan mode
  - Bug fix: ResultPoints from 1D barcodes were wrong
  - SKIP_N_BARCODES hint now gone, and associated logic has been transferred
    to individual project users, as it is fairly app-specific at this point
    and is beginning to complicate the core library. We can help other users
    who need this functionality on a case-by-case basis.

  - Small bug fix / improvement in BlackPointEstimator's estimates
  - 1D decoding now applies a light sharpening filter

    Android client remains in android/ (M5 SDK)
  - Restored ability to read upside-down 1D codes without try-harder mode
  - Added a crude GUI-based decoder to javase/, for the interested
