This project is the same as ZXingBarcodeReader. The difference is that the GUI is 
developed using Qt framework. This means that it can easily be ported to other platforms
supported by Qt by simply changing the camera operations implemented in "QCameraControllerWidget"
which is Symbian specific code.

Also the advantage of this implementation over "ZXingBarcodeReader" is that the code written is 
more readable and familiar to users that have never used Qt framework or Symbian C++ before.

== Prerequisities ==

* Have at least one S60 SDK. One of the SDKs can be obtained from here:
	http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/ec866fab-4b76-49f6-b5a5-af0631419e9c/S60_All_in_One_SDKs.html
	
* After installing S60 SDK you have to install OpenC++.
	http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/91d89929-fb8c-4d66-bea0-227e42df9053/Open_C_SDK_Plug-In.html
	
* Next step, have "Qt for Symbian" installed. It under LGLP licence.
	http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/symbian-cpp
	
* (Optional) You can use Carbide C++ as IDE which makes the life a bit easier on creating applications for Symbian.
	An alternative approach is to compile the program in command line but i am afraid i can help you here because i
	have no idea :P
or
	You can use Qt Creator (see its tutorials on how to use it)

== Create project ==
If you have Carbide C++ IDE then go "File->Import->Qt->Qt Project",
click "Browse" and find and select file "QQrDecoder\QQrDecoder.pro".
Next step you select the S60 SDK to be compiled to and you are ready.

== Build project ==
Since the project is created, we can proceed to build it.

First in "QQrDecoder\camerawrapper" folder there is a folder named "epoc32".
Copy this folder and paste it to the root folder of the S60 SDK that you are going to use
(in my case: C:\S60\devices\S60_5th_Edition_SDK_v1.0). This step is important in order
to use a Plug-In API for the easier manipulation of the camera.

Now we are ready to compile. Since the camera is not supported in the Symbian emulator we
will build the project directly to be installed on a devidce.
Select "QQrDecoder" project in the "Project Explorer" view in Carbide, right click on it
and select "Properties". Expand "Carbide.c++" field and select "Build Configurations".
Being in the "SIS Builder" tab, select as Active Configuration the "Phone Degug (GCCE)".
Then press "Add" button, and to select a PKG file click "Browse" button. Go to "QQrDecoder"
folder and select "QQrDecoder_template.pkg" file. Make sure that "Self sign sis file" radio
button is selected and press OK.

Now go "Project->Build Project" and if everything goes right, you will have 2 installation files
in "QQrDecoder" folder. Install the .sisx file to your device and you are ready.

== Additional information ==

== The same project in Symbian C++ ==

In case you are interested in using this project with only Symbian C++, take a look at ZXingBarcodeReader folder.
