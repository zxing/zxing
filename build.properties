# Set this to a location where Sun's Wireless Toolkit, version 2.5.2 or later, has been installed
# Location on Linux varies but is typically under /usr/local or /usr/lib
# On Windows the default install directory is C:\WTK2.5.2
# Mac users: there is no WTK for Mac at the moment. The installer for Linux may work on Intel-based
# Macs (haven't tried it) but I believe the preverify binary will not run.
